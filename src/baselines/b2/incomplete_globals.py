Task: Execute the provided incomplete code and identify any runtime exceptions.

Use the symbol table to actively track and update the states and types of variables as you execute each line of code. This table helps in understanding the context of variables and their interactions at any point in the execution.

Rules for Handling Errors:
- Ignore exceptions related to missing external modules (e.g., ModuleNotFoundError such as 'os', 'sys', etc.) or undefined names.
- Continue execution even after encountering the above errors, but stop at the first runtime exception that is not a undefined names or ModuleNotFoundError.
- Ensure the execution sequence proceeds from line 1 to the last line of the code snippet or until an error is encountered.

Output Requirements:
- Report whether an error occurred during execution (Yes/No).
- If an error occurred, specify the type of the error.
- Provide the list of executed lines leading up to and including the line where the error occurred.
- Include the exact error message encountered.
- Include the state of the symbol table at the point just before the error occurred. The symbol table should be formatted as: {'variable_name': (last_value, type), ...}.

Example Output:
Error: Yes / No
Error Type: <type>
Execution including the errorline: [1, 2, ..., n]
Error Message: <message>
Symbol Table: {'x': (2, int), 'y': (3.5, float), ...}

Please provide your output in the format specified above. Focus on the significant runtime exceptions and ignore errors related to missing modules or undefined names.
