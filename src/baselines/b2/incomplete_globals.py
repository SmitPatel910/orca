Task:  Execute the provided incomplete code to identify any runtime exceptions, with a focus on executing the code as-is without considering missing import statements or undefined names.

Utilize the symbol table to actively track and update the states and types of variables as you execute each line of code.

Guidelines for Execution:
- Run the code as provided.
- Disregard any errors originating from missing modules (like ModuleNotFoundError) or undefined names.
- Use the symbol table to handle and document changes in variable states and types at each step.
- Stop the execution immediately when a runtime exception is encountered other than those related to missing imports.
- Ensure the execution sequence proceeds from line 1 to the last line of the code snippet, or until an error is encountered.

Expected Output Format:
- Indicate whether a runtime exception occurred (Yes / No).
- If an error is detected, specify the type of the error.
- Provide a list of the lines executed up to the line where the error occurred or the last line of the code snippet.
- Include the error message if an error is detected.
- The symbol table should be formatted as: {'variable_name': (last_value, type), ...}.

Example Output:
Error: Yes / No
Error Type: <type>
Execution including the errorline: [1, 2, ..., n]
Error Message: <message>
Symbol Table: {'x': (2, int), 'y': (3.5, float), ...}
